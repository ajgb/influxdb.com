InfluxDB provides simple, built-in authentication and authorization capabilities.

## Authentication

### Enabling authentication

Authentication is __disabled__ by default.  A new cluster will accept all requests to the API.

When authentication is enabled, every request must be accompanied by a valid username, and the correct password for that username.

_Note: Authentication occurs at the cluster scope.  See the [Authorization](authentication_and_authorization.html#authorization) section for more information on how to grant a user access to a particular database._

To enable authentication, set the `auth-enabled` value to `true` in the `[http]` section of the configuration file (shown below) and restart `influxd`.  

```
[http]
  ...
  auth-enabled = true
  ...
```

### Bootstrapping a new secure cluster

To bootstrap a secure cluster, a [cluster administrator](authentication_and_authorization.html#cluster-administration-privileges) must be created while authentication is disabled.  Once an initial user has been created, restart the cluster with authentication enabled.

_Note: the first user with admin privileges can only be created when authentication is disabled._

### Authenticating requests

When authentication is enabled, user credentials must be supplied with every request via one of following two methods:

- _query parameters in the URL_, with `u` set as the username and `p` set as the password.
- _Basic Authentication_, as described in [RFC 2617, Section 2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617)

If both are present in the same request, user credentials specified in the URL query parameters take precedence over those specified in Basic Auth.

Authentication is checked on every request.  If the request supplies valid credentials for a user in the cluster, the request is processed.  Otherwise, the request is rejected and returns a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP error code.  An authenticated request may still fail if the user is not _authorized_ to execute the requested operation.

_Example_

Send a request with user credentials via query parameters.

```
curl -G http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode "u=mydb_username" --data-urlencode "p=mydb_password" --data-urlencode "q=CREATE DATABASE mydb"
```

Send a request with user credentials via _Basic Authentication_.

```
curl -G http://localhost:8086/query -u mydb_username:mydb_password --data-urlencode "q=CREATE DATABASE mydb"
```

## Authorization

Authorization is set by granting users privileges to access a database or administer the cluster.

Authorization is only enforced when authentication is enabled.  When authentication is disabled, all users have all the privileges of a cluster administrator.

### Cluster administration

Users with cluster administration privileges are known as cluster administrators.  Cluster administrators have read and write access for all databases in a cluster.

Cluster administrators are authorized to execute all of the following administration queries.

- Create and delete users, including admin users
- Set user passwords
- Create and delete databases
- Grant, alter, and revoke database access privileges
- Create and delete retention policies
- Delete measurements and series
- Create and delete continuous queries

The [Cluster Administration](../query_language/database_administration.html) documentation describes the full syntax for administration queries.

### Types of privileges

Users may be assigned one of the following three privileges per database:

- `READ`
- `WRITE`
- `ALL`, grants `READ` and `WRITE`

Cluster administers have `ALL` privileges for all databases even if they have privileges set for a particular database.

## Error messages

When authentication is enabled, all requests which do not provide a valid username and password will receive a `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response.

Queries by authenticated users lacking read or write privileges on the queried database will receive a `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response.

When authentication is disabled, all basic authentication query parameters are silently ignored and all users have all privileges (no authorization is enforced).

## Security in production environments

Authentication and authorization should not be relied upon to prevent access and protect data from malicious actors.  If additional security or compliance features are desired, a cluster should be run behind a third-party service.

## Protected endpoints

Also note that the following API endpoints are currently not protected by authentication. [Relevant github issue](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/1364)

- `GET /data/metastore`
- `POST /data/process_continuous_queries`
